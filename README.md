# :woman_shrugging: **How to Play**
 *Dicee is a two-player game where each player rolls a die, and the player who rolls the highest number wins. This project is a web-based implementation of the game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can play it by opening the index.html file in a web browser.*
# **Files**
**The project consists of the following files:**<br>
* **index.html: The main HTML file that displays the game interface.** <br>
* **styles.css: The CSS file that styles the game interface.** <br>
* **index.js: The JavaScript file that implements the game logic.**
<br> 

# **Logic of the game**
*The logic of this game is to simulate a dice game between two players, where each player rolls a dice and the player with the highest number on their dice wins.*

*The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file contains the structure of the game, including the two dice images and a header displaying the winner. The CSS file styles the game's components, including the font, color, and layout.*

*The JavaScript file contains the logic for generating random numbers between 1 and 6 for each dice, updating the dice images to match the generated numbers, and displaying the winner of the game.*

*The game starts by generating a random number between 1 and 6 for each dice using the Math.random() method. The generated numbers are then used to select the corresponding dice image from the images folder, and the images are updated accordingly using the setAttribute() method.*

*After the dice are rolled and the images are updated, the program checks to see which player won the game by comparing the two generated numbers. If player 1 has a higher number, the program displays "Player 1 Wins!" with a flag emoji. If player 2 has a higher number, the program displays "Player 2 Wins!" with a flag emoji. If both players have the same number, the program displays "Draw!".*

*Overall, the logic of the game is relatively simple, but it provides an entertaining way to simulate a dice game between two players.*
